    "# What is Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a high level programming language which allows you to execute programs very quickly.\n",
    "There are a couple of buzzwords you should familiarize yourself with, in order to truly appreciate \n",
    "and understand what Python has to offer:\n",
    "- Object-oriented\n",
    "- interpreted\n",
    "\n",
    "## Object-orientation\n",
    "When it comes to computer programming, there is often a problem in mind that one wants to be able to solve.\n",
    "Some examples are:\n",
    "- Developing schedules for students at a high school\n",
    "- Calculating dosages for drugs, give input information for a patient\n",
    "- Determining what day of the week a given data was on   \n",
    "\n",
    "A very popular way to think about these projects, and the principal which underpins all of Python, is that of an `object`.\n",
    "An object is a fancy name for what you have identify as an important/relevant collection of information.\n",
    "Some examples for the above list problmes are\n",
    "- Developing schedules for students at a high school\n",
    "    - Schedule: subjects, room numbers\n",
    "    - Student: name, grade, schedule\n",
    "- Calculating dosages for drugs, give input information for a patient\n",
    "    - Drug: name, drugs it can be mixed with, drugs it can't be mixed with\n",
    "    - Patient: name, age, weight, diagnosis, current drugs\n",
    "- Determining what day of the week a given data was on   \n",
    "    - None\n",
    "    \n",
    "The basic idea is that you can break your big problem up into a bunch of smaller tasks, solve all these \n",
    "smaller tasks, and then combine all those solutions to solve our big problem. \n",
    "But note that not all problems always need the full force of thinking in objects, some may just require simple \n",
    "computation.\n",
    "By the end of this mini tutorial we will have solved all of the above list problems using Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interpreted languages\n",
    "Programming languages are examples of human-readible instructions/descriptions you want to give the computer\n",
    "to execute. \n",
    "We say human-readible because all a computer understands is 0s and 1s.\n",
    "Therefore, there has to be an intermediary which translates our human-readible code into machine code (the 0s and 1s).\n",
    "For interpreted languages, this process is very simple: we simply pass our code to an existing program (in our case Python)\n",
    "and it goes through the code line-by-line and tells the computer how to understand it.\n",
    "This is important to understand because it executes your lines of code sequentially."

    "# Let's get to the basics\n",
    "\n",
    "All computer languages have the concepts of `variables` and `functions` built into them.\n",
    "These are variables and functions much in the sense of mathematics:\n",
    "- Variables: can assume some value (integers, decimals, letters, sentence and more)\n",
    "- Functions: Often take some number of variables and do something with these\n",
    "\n",
    "To declare a variable, we simple write the name, an equal sign and what value we want to assign to the variable.\n",
    "Some examples are \n",
    "- `var = 3`\n",
    "- `name = \"Kevin\"`\n",
    "- `height = 70`\n",
    "\n",
    "The rules for writing variable names are:\n",
    "- It can start with any upper or lower case letter or an underscore `_`, it cannot start with a number\n",
    "- It can contain any letter or number or underscore, but not symbols like `-`,`/`,`!`, etc\n",
    "\n",
    "Two common wayes of writing descriptive variable names are camel-case and snake-case:\n",
    "- Camel-case: `WordsSeparatedWithCaps`\n",
    "- Snake-case: `words_separated_with_underscores`\n",
    "\n",
    "Function names follow the same rules as variable names. \n",
    "To declare a function in Python we preceed its name with `def` and append a list of arguments which are comma\n",
    "separated and enclosed by a pair of parentheses (we will see an example shortly), followed by a colon.\n",
    "In Python, the body of the function is all indented under the function name, and is either ended by a `return` statement\n",
    "or an end of indentation:   \n",
    "\n",
    "We now give a couple example functions, the first one takes a name, age and birthday and prints them out to the screen\n",
    "The second one takes no arguments and simply prints the function name, and third returns the square of two numbers.\n",
    "1. \n",
    "```python\n",
    "    def PrintPerson(name, birthday, age):\n",
    "        print(f\"{name} Is {age} years old, and their birhtday is {birthday}\")\n",
